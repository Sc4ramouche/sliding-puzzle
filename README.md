# Sliding Puzzle

## Requirements

- A game field of 3x3 with 8 blocks and one gap; if a block is clicked that borders the gap, it moves into the gap
- Random start locations; but without any duplicate blocks
- The blocks are numbered; 1 to 8
- Responsiveness; the game size adjusts to screen size
- A counter tracking the number of moves

* ðŸš€ Parts of an image instead of numbers in the blocks
* ðŸš€ Win-condition; if successfully completed, give some kind of feedback
* ðŸš€ Dynamic number of blocks; some kind of input whereby the size of the game (and number of blocks) can be increased from 3x3 to any dimension

## Possible improvements

- [picsum](https://picsum.photos/) sometimes fails to deliver the image, thus forcing user to reload the page.
- image being re-fetched while dynamically resizing the window on small screens. This is unlikely to happen to users, but still might cause frustration if user needs to resize browser window mid-game.
- this app could be far more impressive with animations. Consider adding [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) to the mix.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
